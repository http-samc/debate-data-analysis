# debate-data-analysis
Analyzing disparities in national high school PF debate.

## What is it?
This repository is a spinoff of [http-samc/tabroom-api](https://github.com/http-samc/tabroom-api). It uses data from the api (the same one powering [tournaments.tech](http://tournaments.tech)) in order to analyze disparities in Public Forum debate. All data used is available in the `./data` directory.

## How do I use it?
1. Install Python `3.x`.
2. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` from the root of the repository. This will install all required dependencies.
4. Using an adequate IDE/Text Editor that supports Jupyter Notebooks (VS Code does so out of the box), navigate to `./Result Analysis (All)` and run a Jupyter notebook file (each one is its own analysis) to get started.
5. Be sure to submit a pull request if you find something interesting! Just make sure to follow the rough format that the other notebooks do.
